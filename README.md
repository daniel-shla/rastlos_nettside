## 🌱 About  
We aim to bring students together outside of studies through hiking, climbing, running, and other fun activities. Everyone is welcome, no matter your experience level.

## 🌐 Website  
This repository contains the code for [ifirastlos.no](https://ifirastlos.no), a website I created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to support and promote the student organization.  

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
